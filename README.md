# Meta Prompting E2E Testing with Playwright

This project is an experimental integration of meta prompting techniques with a single model to facilitate end-to-end (E2E) testing using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). The goal is to leverage advanced prompt engineering to guide automated testing scenarios, enabling more human-like reasoning and adaptability in test generation and execution.

## Key Features

- **Meta Prompting Integration**: Incorporate large language model (LLM) prompts that dynamically influence testing strategies and coverage.
- **Playwright Compatibility**: Utilize Playwright’s robust browser automation capabilities to run tests across multiple browsers and devices.
- **E2E Testing Focus**: Automate comprehensive testing flows from start to finish, ensuring high-level accuracy and reliability for web applications.
- **Adaptive Test Generation**: Explore using LLMs to reason about test cases, improve test clarity, and adapt testing scenarios based on previous outcomes.

## Project Status

**Note:** This project is currently in its very early stages. The repository may not yet contain a fully functional integration or extensive documentation. As development progresses, we’ll provide more details, code examples, and best practices for using meta prompting in E2E testing.
